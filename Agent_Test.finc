; Computer agent framework is encapsulated within a single macro. Parts are
; subdivided into the follow sections:
;
;    NAME - Visual appearance of agent in application. Macro name is used at
;           assemble time and they need not be the same.
;
;   CONST -
;    DATA -
;     BSS -
;
;    INIT - (boot-strap your AI)
;    CODE - Execution for agent begins at the start and needs to exit at the
;           bottom. Application handles prolog/epilog - no label required.
;
; Add the macro name to the list of agents and re-compile.
; Only include the parts needed.
